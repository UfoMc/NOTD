# NOTD

Hello there 👋🏻
Im glad you found here. Today I coded NOTD (Number of the day).
I know, for most of yall it wont have any usage but its a nice tool tho. 

`Here is what it does:`
-

The number of the day is a system I thought about while watching prison break. 
There where multiple hostages and the hostage-takers where sending a pic of them with the dayli newspaper every day so mical would know they still live.
Soo I thoght wy not make a website with a number of the day wich is not calculable.
Also you can search what number belongs to what date in the past and other way around 2.
Also I learned very much while coding it so it has a great value to me :D

Feel free to use it how ever you want :D
